# Shear Deformation Pathways of Cu-Ni Multilayers via Neural Net Potential

A trained neural net potential (NNP) was use to simulate shear in the [011] direction in Cu-Ni multilayers. We applied the NNP to a Monte Carlo scheme to generate parallel shear simulations, demonstrating the range of possible trajectories that can be obtained due to speedups provided by the NNP.
